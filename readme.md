Server must be run before the client otherwise it will fail

For Server

1. first start server in the terminal
    1.1 To the server in the terminal type python FinalServer.py 
    1.2 For server to start you must have python3 or above installed


2. Then the server will ask for p and q
    2.1 p and q must be prime number and different from each other

3. After that server can send the message to the client by writing in the terminal


For Client

1. First start the client in the terminal

2. type python FinalClient.py to start it
    2.1 you must have python3 or above to run it

3. Then it will ask for prime number p and 1
    3.1 p and q must be prime and different from each other

4. Then it will ask for message to send to client


                RSA algorithm for encryption of keys generated by symmetric key IDEA algorithm

function used

1. gcd(a, b)
    for calculatin gcd of two number a and b using euclids algorithm

2. multiplicative_inverse(e, phi)
    for generating multiplicative inverse using extended euclidean algoritm

3. isPrime(n)
    for checking wheather a number is prime or not it returns boolen value

4. generate_key_pair(p, q)
    for generating public and private keys using RSA algorithm public key is then shared with other.
    by using public keys others send message which is letter decrypted by using private key

5. encrypt(public_key, plaintext)
    function for encrypting the plaintext using public key of receiver it takes public key and plaintext 
    or message to be sent ans input

6. decrypt(private_key, ciphtertext)
    function used by receiver to decrypt the message sent to the receiver by using his/her public key
    it takes private and ciphertext as input



            IDEA ALGORITHM FOR ENCRYPTING AND DECRPYTING MESSAGE

function used

These function are defined in seperate file from there it is import 

1. idea(block, key, mode)
    function for encrypting/decrypting depending on mode
    if mode == "e"
    it is used for encryption
    if mode == "d"
    it is used for decryption

    it takes message block, key and mode ans input and generate encrpyted or decrypted message for output depending on mode

2. generate_subkeys(key)
    function for generating subkeys from main key

3. generate_decrypt_keys(key)
    function for generating subkeys used for decryption of message

4. m_mul_inv(a, b)
    function for generating multiplicative inverse
5. m_sum_inv(a, b)
    funtion for generating additive inverse

6. XOR(a, b)
    function for calculating XOR of two numbers

7. split_into_x_parts_of_y(data, m, n)
    function for spliting the data into parts

8. circular_left_shift(binString, k)
    function for cirular left shifting of binary string

9. str_to_bits(string)
    function for converting string to binary string

10. int2bits(int)
    function for converting integer to binary string

11. decode_binary_string(string)
    function for converting binary string to string 

12. m_mul(a, b)
    function for modular multiplication
13. m_sum(a, b)
    function for modular summation
